keen on getting going with this package, jump straight to the end and read the
installation instructions.

Motivation

    ----- Extract from MathWorks' Website on Simulink Coder: ----
    Simulink Coder (formerly Real-Time Workshop) generates and executes C and
    C++ code from Simulink diagrams, Stateflow charts, and MATLAB functions.
    The generated source code can be used for real-time and non real time
    applications, including simulation acceleration, rapid prototyping, and
    hardware-in-the-loop testing. You can tune and monitor the generated code
    using Simulink or run and interact with the code outside MATLAB and
    Simulink.
    (http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder/index.html)
    -------------------------------------------------------------
 
    First and foremost, Simulink Coder generates C/C++ code from Simulink
    diagrams. This generated code is generic in the sense that a support
    framework is required to make it run.  Typically this framework is
    provided for the targets on which the executable will run. The framework
    ensures execution (maybe in real time), possible interaction with signals
    and parameters, and real world input and output with sensors and
    actuators.
 
    Simulink Coder comes with a generic real time target (grt). This target
    creates an executable that runs on Linux for example. However, neither
    Simulink nor Simulink Coder blockset supply sources or sinks to interact
    with real world sensors. The generated executable does not run in real
    time and interaction with signals and parameters are limited to External
    Mode Communication within the Simulink diagram.
 
    PdServ is a library that facilitates interaction with another process
    using shared memory only. No system calls are used between the library and
    its process. System calls are a major stumbling block real time
    applications have to deal with.
 
    EtherLab is a target for Simulink Coder to generate an executable that
    works with PdServ. Thus the executable has all the possibilities PdServ
    has.
    
    EtherLab also supplies an extensive blockset to interact with the real
    world from within the Simulink diagram. Most importantly, it works very
    closely with EtherCAT. This opens a enormous range of IO devices that can
    be used at the diagram level.

Installation

    From source files:
    You need:
        - the source tarball
        - installed pdserv environment (not a prerequisite, but is required
          when the executable is generated)
        - cmake, version 2.6 or higher
    Here it goes:
        $ tar xfj etherlab-X.Y.Z.tgz
        $ cd etherlab-X.Y.Z
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make install

    From Debian or rpm package:
        Install the package.

Configuration

    Regardless whether you install using a package manager or from source
    code, the package has to be configured to work with MATLAB.

    Start MATLAB, and call setup:
    >> run /opt/etherlab/rtw/setup_etherlab.m

    This configures the package for use with Simulink. Note that the setup
    script stores everything in /opt/etherlab and doesn't change anything in
    your filesystem, except for adding and saving some paths
    (/opt/etherlab/rtw/*) to your MATLAB path
    ($(MATLAB_ROOT)/toolbox/local/pathdef.m) which is in your matlab
    installation. If you don't have permission to change this file, the setup
    script will complain. Somehow make sure that the required paths will be
    found every time MATLAB is started.

Using EtherLab

    Now open a Simulink diagram. From the diagram, open the Configuration
    Parameters (Menu: Simulation -> Configuration Parameters, or press Ctrl-E
    from within the Simulink diagram). Choose Code Generation tab, and select
    "etherlab.tlc" for System target file. Go to the Solver tab and choose a
    Fixed-step size, such as 0.001. Select the appropriate solver and a
    Tasking mode (SingleTasking or MultiTasking) for your application. Go back
    to the Code Generation tab and press Build button (Pressing Ctrl-B from
    within the diagram also works). Voilà, you have an executable! Call it and
    be happy.

Using EtherLab in a hosted environment

    MATLAB, Simulink and Simulink Coder is a significant financial investment
    that is typically installed only on a limited number of systems. These
    licenses are definitely NOT required to run the executable.
    
    While it is easy to transfer the generated executable to a system with a
    similar runtime environment as that of the host (of coarse, including
    pdserv and possibly EtherCAT libraries), you may have the requirement to
    generate only C/C++ code with the MATLAB installation and build the
    executable on another machine. This is for instance when MATLAB is
    installed on a Windows machine while your target will run on Linux.
    
    In this case, select "Generate code only" from the "Code Generation" tab
    of the Configuration Parameters.

    Now copy the directory <model>_etl_hrt to the target machine. Also copy
    the following files from your MATLAB installation:
            $(MATLAB_ROOT)/extern/include
            $(MATLAB_ROOT)/simulink/include/
            $(MATLAB_ROOT)/rtw/c/src/
    to the target somewhere (such as /opt/matlab).

    Dive into the directory containing <model>_etl_hrt -- not into the
    directory <model>_etl_hrt itself. Type
    $ make -C <model>_etl_hrt -f <model>.mk \
                MATLAB_DIR=/opt/matlab ETHERLAB_DIR=/opt/etherlab
    and there you go! (MATLAB_DIR and/or ETHERLAB_DIR may be omitted if that
    is the same as on the host where the code is generated)

    If the code is generated on a windows host, you will have to edit
    <model>_etl_hrt/<model>.mk and remove references to drive letters (e.g.
    C:\...) that Simulink Coder inserts automatically. GNU make chokes on
    these lines, so you are required to edit the file unfortunately.

Removing EtherLab

    Installation using:
        - package manager: remove EtherLab
        - source files: rm -rf /opt/etherlab/rtw

    From Matlab:
    >> pathtool
    remove references to /opt/etherlab/rtw. Save path.
