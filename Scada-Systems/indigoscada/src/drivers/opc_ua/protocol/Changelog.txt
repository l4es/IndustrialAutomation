OPC Foundation OPC UA ANSI C-Stack
====================================

Current Version

Version 1.03.341

	Highlights:
		- added cmake build support for both linux and windows in addition to existing tooling.
		- added support for OpenSSL 1.1.x in linux and windows.
			Linux: build_linux.sh works if openssl-1.1.0f or newer is installed, or the
			necessary include path and lib path is given with the build command:
			./build_linux.sh MACHINE_OPT="-I $OSSL_INSTALL/include -L $OSSL_INSTALL/lib"
			Windows: build_win32.bat and build_win64.bat look for the extracted openssl-1.1.0f
			or newer and build that if found.  Strawberry perl has to be installed.
		- added new security profiles Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep and Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss.
			Note: Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or newer.

	API changes from the 1.03.340 version:

		- removed OPCUA_SECURELISTENER_SUPPORT_THREADPOOL because of inherent race conditions (issue #32)
		- added a new configure option to control access in discovery only mode (issue #25):
			Use OPCUA_SECURELISTENER_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_FSON to enable FindServersOnNetwork in discoyery only mode.
			Note: Always leave this option disabled unless you are building the Stack for use in the LDS.
		- fixed memory leaks (issue #27, #28, #29)
		- fixed encoding of uMessageSecurityModes (issue #36):
			The value returned from OpcUa_Endpoint_GetMessageSecureChannelSecurityPolicy
			used the wrong enumeration type OpcUa_MessageSecurityMode instead of
			OPCUA_ENDPOINT_MESSAGESECURITYMODE values.
		- fixed OpcUa_EncodeableTypeTable_AddTypes and OpcUa_ProxyStub_AddTypes were potentially moving
			type entries around.  This rarely used API was changed to not copying the type entries.
			Therefore the a_pType parameter should always be from the static storage class.
		- added new API function OpcUa_DestroySecretData.
		- changed the signature of LoadPrivateKeyFromFile to return the private key in a OpcUa_Key structure.
		- changed the signature of OpcUa_Channel_BeginConnect and OpcUa_Channel_Connect to expect
			a pPrivateKey of type OpcUa_Key.

Version 1.03.340
	
	Highlights: 
		- OPC UA 1.03 compatible.
		- all BSI reported security issues addressed.
		- linux platform added.
		- windows and linux layers work with 32 and 64 bit O/S.
		- optimised async sockets handling implemented.
		- windows and linux implement full IPv6 support.
		- pki store implementation reworked to be more flexible.
		- conformant with strict aliasing rules.
		- enumeral values are checked on receive.
		- https protocol reworked and now basically stable.
		- negotiates tls1 to tls1_2, supports DHE protocols.
		- tested with gcc's sanitizer asan, tsan and ubsan.
			
	API changes from the 1.02.336 version:
		- 3393 OpcUa_ProxyStubConfiguration: The data type has been extended.
				bProxyStub_Trace_Enabled set to OpcUa_True to enable traces.
				iSerializer_MaxRecursionDepth if unsure, set to -1.
		- 3394 OpcUa_Xxx_CopyTo: This set of functions is not supported.
		- 3395 OpcUa_Guid_Copy: This function is deprecated now and should
				not be used any more, because the source and destination
				parameters were exchanged in the past, and thus it is not clear
				what this function can be expected to do.
		- 3396 OpcUa_EncodeabeTypeTable_AddTypes: The function signature has 
				changed.
				noOfEncodeableType was removed.
				ppTypes is assumed to be null-terminated.
		- 3397 OpcUa_Endpoint_Open: The function signature has changed.
				sTransportProfileUri was removed because it is redundant.
				bListenOnAllInterfaces was added.  If unsure, use OpcUa_True.
				pPrivateKey->Key.Data must be non-zero, even if no security.
		- 3398 OpcUa_Endpoint_Callback: The function signature has changed.
				phRawRequestContext and uRequestedLifetime have been removed.
		- 3399 OpcUa_Endpoint_Event: Some enum values are not supported.
		- 3400 OpcUa_Channel_SecurityToken: This data type is not supported.
		- 3401 OpcUa_Channel_Connect: The function signature has changed.
				sTransportProfileUri has been removed because it is redundant.
				ppSecurityToken is not supported and has been removed.
		- 3402 OpcUa_Channel_ConnetionStateChanged: The function singature
				has changed.
				pSecurityToken is not supported and has been removed.
		- 3403 OpcUa_Channel_Event: Some enum values are not supported.
		- 3404 OpcUa_CertificateStoreConfiguration: has to be replaced by
				OpcUa_P_OpenSSL_CertificateStore_Config.
				In the most simple configuation just set the following:
					pki.PkiType=OpcUa_OpenSSL_PKI;
					pki.CertificateTrustListLocation="PKI/certs";
					pki.Flags=0;
				Use OPCUA_P_PKI_OPENSSL_XXX flags for PKI type OpenSSL
				Use OPCUA_P_PKI_WIN32_XXX flags for PKI type Win32
		- 3405 OpcUa_Crypto_CreateCertificate: The function signature has
				changed.
				 Instead of validFrom and validTo use validToInSec.
				 validToInSec is the time in seconds how long the generated
				 certificate will be valid.
				 pIssuerCertificate has been removed as only self-signed
				 certificate are supported.
				 pCertificate holds a OpcUa_ByteString with the generated
				 certificate, instead of a raw X509 pointer.
		- 3406 OpcUa_Crypto_GenerateAsymmetricKeypair has been changed to
				allocate the memory for PublicKey and PrivateKey.
		- 3407 OpcUa_PKIProvider_SavePrivateKeyToFile is not supported.
		- 3408 OpcUa_P_OpenSSL_X509_SaveToFile was an internal function
				and has been removed.
		- 3409 OPCUA_USE_STATIC_PLATFORM_INTERFACE is not supported.
		- 3410 OPCUA_MULTITHREADED: CONFIG_NO is supported,
				 but you must call OpcUa_SocketManager_Create(OpcUa_Null,0,0)
				 before OpcUa_Endpoint_Open, and you must call
				 OpcUa_SocketManager_Delete(OpcUa_Null) between
				 OpcUa_Endpoint_Close and Opcua_Endpoint_Delete.
		- 3411 OpcUa_Endpoint_GetPeerInfoBySecureChannelId is not supported,
				use OpcUa_Endpoint_GetPeerInfo instead.
